# Things-you-do-with-Python
Programs and Projects which we can do by using basic concepts of Python.
These are some of the early mini-programs and modules that I built which every beginner should work upon
1. Desktop Widget : 
The program uses tkinter to create a semi-transperent widget shaped window which will continuosly be on the desktop screen.
It uses os library as it shows the memory usage in percent in the window.
2. File Handling in Python : It has three subfolders, it shows how python deals with files for ex: xls here, it also has a program which only allows write permission to the file if the login id password is correct and third is a program which searches a string in any file which is useful if run on loop
3. Operators in Python : This program is a simple calculator to understand the use of operators in Python
4. Play a song with Python : Always keep searching how to automate stuff with python.
5. Question&Answer algorithm : It keeps a file which has all the answers to its known question, if you ask a new question it will ask to add it in file or not. That way the file is ever growing.
